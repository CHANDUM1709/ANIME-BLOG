      <strong>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba –The Movie:</strong>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Infinity Castle</em> (Japanese:
      劇場版「鬼滅の刃」無限城編, Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen
      Jō-hen)[a] is a 2025 Japanese animated dark fantasy action film based on
      the <mark>"Infinity Castle"</mark> arc of the 2016–20 manga series Demon
      Slayer: <mark>Kimetsu no Yaiba by Koyoharu Gotouge</mark>. It is a direct
      sequel to the fourth season of the anime television series as well as the
      manga fourth, fifth, and sixth adaptations, following the film Mugen Train
      (2020) and the feature-length compilations To the Swordsmith Village
      (2023) and To the Hashira Training (2024). It is directed by Haruo
      Sotozaki, produced by Ufotable, and written by the studio's staff members.
      Unlike the Swordsmith Village and Hashira Training adaptations, which are
      compilations of episodes from the anime series, Infinity Castle is a
      feature-length multi-film adaptation due to the arc's content and dramatic
      pacing, similarly to Mugen Train. It is the first film of a trilogy
      announced in June 2024, immediately following the airing of the fourth
      season's finale.[5] It was released in Japan on July 18, 2025, by Aniplex
      and Toho. It was released by Crunchyroll through Sony Pictures Releasing
      in select Asian countries in August, before releasing in all other
      territories the following month. The film broke several box office records
      and grossed <mark>$648 million</mark> worldwide, becoming the
      highest-grossing Japanese film, the highest-grossing international film in
      the U.S. previously held by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), and the
      fifth-highest-grossing film of 2025.[b] The film received generally
      positive reviews from critics, who praised its action sequences, visuals,
      and engaging story, although the pacing received some criticism.

      <strong>Death Note</strong> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga
      series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. It was
      serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from
      December 2003 to May 2006, with its chapters collected in 12 tankōbon
      volumes. The story follows Light Yagami, a genius high school student who
      discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the
      shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill
      anyone whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around
      Light's subsequent use of the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre
      of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society,
      using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent
      efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective
      L, to apprehend him. A 37-episode anime television series adaptation,
      produced by Madhouse and directed by Tetsurō Araki, was broadcast on
      Nippon Television from October 2006 to June 2007. A light novel based on
      the series, written by Nisio Isin, was also released in 2006.
      Additionally, various Death Note video games have been published by Konami
      for the Nintendo DS. The series was adapted into three live-action films
      released in Japan in June, November 2006, and February 2008, and a
      television drama in 2015. A miniseries titled Death Note: New Generation
      and a fourth film were released in 2016. An American film adaptation was
      released exclusively on Netflix in August 2017, and a series is reportedly
      in the works. Two one-shot manga sequels, C-Kira and a-Kira, were
      published in 2008 and 2020, respectively; they were later collected in a
      single volume titled Death Note: Short Stories, alongside other standalone
      stories, in 2021. An online social deduction game, Death Note: Killer
      Within, was released by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 5,
      PlayStation 4, and Windows via Steam in 2024. Death Note media, except for
      video games and soundtracks, is licensed and released in North America by
      Viz Media. The anime series was first made available in North America as
      downloadable from IGN before Viz Media licensed it. The series aired on
      YTV's Bionix programming block in Canada and on Adult Swim in the United
      States, with a DVD release following shortly after. The live-action films
      briefly showed in certain North American theaters in 2008 before receiving
      home video releases. By April 2015, the Death Note manga had over 30
      million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga
      series.
